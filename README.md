- I can convert binary code to regular numbers and vice versa
- It seems to me that Linux... Is it like an addiction... or love? At least for me
- I constantly have ideas that push me to create a new project that will be the best of its kind, but I always create something that is not what I wanted due to laziness...
- I use Windows... HOME EDITION. I tried to make Windows look like Ubuntu or Fedora, but it’s not the same... I installed a linux distribution on a second hard drive, but I had to delete it due to lack of space...
- My UEFI won't let me put the Windows bootloader in front of GRUB, press F12...

- I also play Team Fortress 2! 😁🎉😎🤩
